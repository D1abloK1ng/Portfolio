    <p>
        This is another website I made.
        <br>
        Its a website used to keep up on and plan around everything pokemon.
        <br>
        It has news around pokemon game releases and anime news etc.
        <br>
        However this website was a project for a class so it's no longer up to date.
        <br>
        You can visit this website by clicking the image or by clicking this link.

        This was a school project I did.
        <br>
        Its an interactive mars simulator with options and consequences.
        <br>
        You play as the captain and you have to make decisions for your crew and make it to the end without dying.

    <!--Project description-->
    <p>
        This is another similar mars based game.
        <br>
        However it was more made to show off my coding skills.
        <br>
        This game is not interactive, instead its a captains log that you can read through.
        <br>
        And if you do, you can pick up hints that build out the entire world inside the dialogue.

    <!--Project description-->
    <p>
        This was the first game I ever created.
        <br>
        It's a point and click horror game that I created as a final project for a class.
        <br>
        However more importantly it's a passion project for me, 
        <br>
        because its my dream to make games and I grew up on indie horror games like this.
        <br>
        One day I hope to make this passion project into a fully fledged game.

        UE5 Project

    </div>

    <!--Project description-->
    <p>
        Like most of my other projects this was a school project.
        <br>
        This was also my introduction to UE5 and game programming in terms of scripting and using blueprints instead of actually coding.
        <br>
        This game doesn't have story its more of a project I used to learn UE5 and game programming in general.
